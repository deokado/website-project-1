# website-project-1
This is my first web design project.
This project is a simple, modern website template. It has a top menu that stays in place when you scroll, a main section with a bold headline, a section showing services with image cards, and a footer with links to social media. The design uses CSS for colors, animations, and to make sure it looks good on phones and computers. JavaScript is added to create a mobile-friendly menu button. The site is bright and clean, ideal for promoting tech products or services.
